The folders have been separate with Data and Plotting Files. 
When first writing these files, they were all contained in the same folder.
To run properly make sure to create a local copy on Desktop, Documents, etc. and make sure they are in the same folder.

If you have any questions please contact Erik (eajung@ucsc.edu).
â€¢ Note to self: The plotting files for this definitely need to be commented better.
