This document is a tool used to help gather old and new forms of technology advancements related to magnetic actuators and exoskeletons.
The proposed idea is to create a lower body exoskeleton using tensegrity fundamentals for bio-inspired muscle induced motion with a mixture of magnetic joints for high impact areas of contact.
This being said, this is only an idea and the purpose of this document is discover the possibilities or limitations this form of technology provides.
